I am looking to create a system where the Arduino can detect tension in fabric. The larger goal is to be able to automatically determine
whether a garment is too tight or too loose on any given person. The arduino would determine what areas of the textile are pulling more 
than others and then give a precise amount by which the section of the garment should be relaxed or adjusted. 

I bought a pull sensor from Adafruit (it won't arrive to me until the weekend) but it is a string of cord that can put our a reading in 
ohms. By combining the cord with a piece of knit fabric that stretches, I can assign a numerical value to the stretch of the fabric. 

My goal, if I had the right parts, would be to use the pull sensor in the same way we used the light sesnor in class - by having an LED dim
or brighten based on the tension (when the light is off, there is 0 tension). Here is my code, which is mistly the same from class, but with 
different numbers for use with the new sensor.

int ledPin = 9;
int brightness = 0;
int sensorLow = 2100;
int sensorHigh = 3500;

void setup() {
Serial.begin(9600);
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
Serial.println(brightness);
brightness = map(sensorValue, sensorLow, sensorHigh, 0, 255);
analogWrite(ledPin, brightness);
delay(300);
}


I am not sure I am doing this right, though, because the numbers coming from the pull sensor are in ohms. Do I need to convert this to a 
voltage in order to be able to manipulate it in code?
